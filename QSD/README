How to build QSD (Quick Sequence Diagram Editor) with Maven 3 and
run it:

1. Get QSD-lib and QSD from github.
2. cd to the QSD-lib directory
3. type mvn install
4. cd to the QSD directory
5. type: mvn package
6. type: java -jar target/QSD-4.2.one-jar.jar 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all jar files required by QSD (Quick Sequence Diagram Editor)
are present at the Maven Central Repository, so a project repository
is included (the repo/ directory).

* org/freehep/freehep-graphics2d/2.4 (only present as an empty artifact)
* org/freehep/freehep-graphicsio/2.4-patched (patched by me so there are
  more page sizes available)
* com/apple/ui/1.0 (kind of proprietary, not available at Maven Central all)
* net/iharder/filedrop/1.0 (not available at Maven Central at all)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that to compile one class (net.sf.sdedit.taglet.SequenceTaglet) the
tools.jar from the JDK lib directory is required, which I have not put
inside the repository.
