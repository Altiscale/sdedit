QSD (Quick Sequence Diagram Editor) looks like a Maven project, but it should
still be built and compiled with Ant.

Some of the required jar files (of which most belong to Freehep) are available
at mvnrepository.com, other artifacts seem to be just placeholders without a
jar file, for example 

http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.freehep/freehep-vectorgraphics/2.4

So I had to build the jar files from the sources and put them into the github
repository.

Any help of anybody who knows how to solve this issue and make QSD a proper
Maven project will be appreciated: markus-strauch@arcor.de

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So the solution - for now - remains ant:

cd to the directory of this README file and type:

ant clean

ant compile

ant run

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that to compile one class (net.sf.sdedit.taglet.SequenceTaglet) the
tools.jar from the JDK lib directory is required, which I have not put
inside the repository.
