  <h2>
    <a name="basic_example">A basic example</a>
  </h2>

  <p>We are starting with a simple example, involving only two
    objects and a single message. A master object asks a servant object
    to execute a task. The servant finishes the task and answers "done".
  </p>
  <p>The text starts with two lines declaring the objects (name of
    the object followed by : and the class name). The object declaration
    is terminated by an empty line. It follows the single message in the form:
    caller:answer=callee.message.</p>

  <div class="sd">
    <img name="basic" src="sd/basic.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master
s:Servant
			
m:done=s.executeTask()</pre>
  </div>

  <h2>
    <a name="anonymous">Anonymous objects</a>
  </h2>

  <p>Every object has to have its own name. They can however be
    declared anonymous [a], so their name will not appear on the
    diagram.</p>

  <div class="sd">
    <img name="anonymous" src="sd/anonymous.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master[a]
s:Servant
      
m:done=s.executeTask()</pre>
  </div>

  <h2>
    <a name="stacking">Stacking</a>
  </h2>

  <p>Now we assume that the servant object needs some information
    from the master in order to complete its task, so it makes a call
    back to the master, who is reached by the program flow for the
    second time then. This is represented by a second lifeline stacked
    upon the master's first lifeline.</p>

  <div class="sd">
    <img name="stacking" src="sd/stacking.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master[a]
s:Servant
d:Database

m:done=s.executeTask()
s:information=m.getSomeInformation()
m:result=d.query()</pre>
  </div>


  <h2>
    <a name="levels">Message levels</a>
  </h2>

  <p>In the previous example, right after the servant has asked the master
    for an information, the latter queries a database, presumably for
    finding the required information.</p>
  <p>But the master could as well give the information instantly and
    query the database thereafter, for finding out something else. In
    this case the getSomeInformation() call must be terminated before
    the query is made. This can be achieved by a "[1]" behind the caller
    name, which means: terminate 1 level of execution in which the
    object is involved, then send the message.</p>

  <div class="sd">
    <img name="levels" src="sd/levels.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master[a]
s:Servant
d:Database

m:done=s.executeTask()
s:information=m.getSomeInformation()
m[1]:result=d.query()
</pre>
  </div>

  <h2>
    <a name="constructor">Constructor</a>
  </h2>
  
  <p>The servant might create a new object for completing his task.
     This new object must already be a part of the object section,
     with its name prefixed by "/". It appears on the diagram
     as soon as it receives a "new" message. It cannot receive
     other messages before that.
  </p> 

  <div class="sd">
    <img name="constructor" src="sd/constructor.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master
s:Servant
/f:File

m:done=s.executeTask()
s:f.new()
</pre>
  </div>


  <h2>
    <a name="destructor">Destructor</a>
  </h2>
  
  <p>
  Any object (not just newly created ones) can be explicitly removed 
  from the diagram when it is
  no longer needed. This can be accomplished by a "destroy"
  message.
  </p>

  <div class="sd">
    <img name="destructor" src="sd/destructor.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master[a]
s:Servant
/f:File

m:done=s.executeTask()
s:f.new()
s:f.save()
s:f.destroy()
</pre>
  </div>

  <h2>
    <a name="automatic">Automatic object</a>
  </h2>
  
  <p>
  You can make Quick Sequence Diagram Editor find out on its own when
  an object is no longer needed, which means that it is not and will not
  be involved in an interaction anymore.</p>
  <p>
  Objects with the "x" flag set are treated like this. They
  will be destroyed automatically.
  </p>
  

  <div class="sd">
    <img name="automatic" src="sd/automatic.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master[a]
s:Servant
/f:File[x]

m:done=s.executeTask()
s:f.new()
s:f.save()
m:s.destroy()
</pre>
  </div>

  <h2>
    <a name="thread">Threads</a>
  </h2>
  
  <p>
  We might use a separate thread on which the servant completes his
  task, so the master can do something else instead of just waiting
  for the servant.
  </p>
  <p>
  When in a message the caller is separated from the callee by
  ":&gt;" and not just ":" 
  (<tt>m:&gt;s.executeTask()</tt> instead of <tt>m:s.executeTask</tt>) a new
  thread is created. The caller can now send other messages without
  interfering with the activity started by the callee.  
  </p>

  <div class="sd">
    <img name="thread" src="sd/thread.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master
s:Servant
/f:File[x]
d:Database

m:&gt;s.executeTask()
s:f.new()
m:d.query()
s:f.save()
s:m.done()
</pre>
  </div>

  <h2>
    <a name="return">Returning instantly</a>
  </h2>
  
  <p>
  In the previous example, the master's call to the database
  seems to take a long time to complete. This is because the
  master does not start any other activity and there is no need
  for the call-flow to return to the master.
  </p>
  <p>
  But often this is not intended, e. g. because the call to the
  database actually is performed very quickly. When you add &amp;
  as a suffix to a message (<tt>m:d.query()&amp;</tt>) the call-flow
  returns instantly to the caller.
  </p>

  <div class="sd">
    <img name="return" src="sd/return.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master
s:Servant
/f:File[x]
d:Database

m:&gt;s.executeTask()
s:f.new()&amp;
m:d.query()&amp;
s:f.save()
s:m.done()
</pre>
  </div>

  <h2>
    <a name="signal">Signals</a>
  </h2>
  
  <p>
  In the previous examples, the servant sends a <tt>done()</tt> message to the
  master in order to indicate that he has finished his task. It might
  seem inappropriate that, as a consequence of the <tt>done()</tt>
  message, the yellow thread's call-flow remains for some time at the
  master.
  </p>
  <p>
  A combination of thread-creation and instant returning comes in handy
  here (<tt>s:&gt;m.done()&amp;</tt>). It results in an arrow indicating only
  a signal without actually creating a new call-flow or continuing an
  existing one. 
  </p>

  <div class="sd">
    <img name="signal" src="sd/signal.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master
s:Servant
/f:File[x]
d:Database

m:&gt;s.executeTask()
s:f.new()&amp;
m:d.query()&amp;
s:f.save()
s:&gt;m.done()&amp;
</pre>
  </div>

  <h2>
    <a name="note">Notes</a>
  </h2>
  
  <p>We can put notes on the diagram and associate them to lifelines or
  messages. A note is declared inside the message 
  section, if starts 
  with + or * followed by a unique number and the name of a lifeline
  and is terminated by + or * followed by the
  same number. For example:
  </p>
  <p>
  <tt>+1 s1<br/>
  This is a note to appear beside s1<br/>
  +1<br/>
  </tt>
  </p>
  
  <p>  
   + creates a note that consumes its own vertical space,
  whereas a note declared with * is just placed on the right side of the
  indicated lifeline without adding any space, which might lead to a
  collision.</p>
  
  <p>
  Any note that is ever declared on a diagram can be associated to
  any number of lifelines and messages before or afterwards. An association to a lifeline
  is accomplished by the note number in parentheses followed by the
  lifeline name, for example
  </p>
  <p>
  <tt>(1) s1</tt>
  </p>
  <p>
  whereas an association to a
  message is made when the message is prefixed by the parenthised note number,
  for example
  </p>
  <p>
  <tt>(3) s1:data=f.read()</tt>
  </p>


  <div class="sd">
    <img name="note" src="sd/note.png"/>
    <pre>m:Master
s1:Servant[x]
s2:Servant[x]
/f:File[x]
d:Database

m:&gt;s1.start()

s2:&gt;m.done()&amp;
s1:&gt;m.done()&amp;</pre>
  </div>

  <h2>
    <a name="reuse_space">Reusing space</a>
  </h2>
  
  <p>When an object is <a href="#destructor">destroyed</a> or removed
  <a href="#automatic">automatically</a>, the column of the screen where
  its lifeline was displayed is no longer used, so it might be reused
  by objects that are <a href="#constructor">created</a> thereafter.
  This applies only to objects with the [v] variable flag set.
  </p>
  <div class="sd">
    <img name="reuse_space" src="sd/reuse_space.png"/>

  <h2>
    <a name="user-colors">User-defined colors</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
     If you want to style arrows and texts with individual colors, e. g.
     for grouping them visually, you can insert a comment starting with #! 
     before the messages you want to style. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The comment should read like a CSS block on a single line. The property
    "color" defines the color of the arrow and the text, whereas
    "background-color" defines the text's background color.
  </p>
  <p>
    An empty comment (#!) resets your color settings, texts will be black,
    arrows will be colored normally.
  </p>

  <p>When a new thread is started (and a message from an user always
    starts a new thread) it does not stop until it is explicitly stopped
    or until the diagram ends. E.g. atm:stop terminates the atm thread</p>
  <p>here a first attempt (everything in multithreaded mode):</p>

  <h2>
    <a name="async2">Another version with asynchronous messages</a>

  <p>(arguably the messages should be asynchronous, since they are

  <p>"&gt;" at the start of a message starts a new thread (all
    messages from users and processes start a new thread by default.)</p>
  <p>"&amp;" at the end means that the call returns immediately, and
    the new thread is not shown. you can use this to simulate sending
    messages to existing threads. (all messages TO users and processes
    always return immediately by default. )</p>
