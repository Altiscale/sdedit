/**
 * This is a taglet that generates sequence diagrams from the contents of
 * <tt>@sequence.diagram</tt> tags. The diagrams are saved as PNG files in a
 * child directory of the javadoc destination directory (as specified by the -d
 * option). Inside the html pages generated by javadoc, the files are referenced
 * using a relative path, so the references remain valid if the pages are moved
 * - for example, uploaded to a webserver.
 * <p>
 * If the first line of the tag content is "quoted" it will be used as title for
 * the diagram instead of the default "Sequence Diagram:"

 * <tt>@sequence.diagram</tt> are no inline tags and they can be used inside
 * classes, and inside package documentation.
