Quick Sequence Diagram Editor 4.2 is a simplified release (some more or less 
experimental features that are not very useful were removed or are still being
removed) with a slightly improved documentation (there is a tutorial now).

The old documentation has still to be revised, there may be still some 
explanations of features that have already been removed (see above).

Version 4.2 contains Freehep Vectorgraphics 2.4 which should run now on any 
platform with any Java version from 1.6 on. The former version had some
problems because it used internal APIs that changed with Java 1.7.
